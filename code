To use this script:

Save the code into a Python file (e.g., task_tracker.py).
Make sure you have write access to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the menu options to add tasks or view today's tasks.
The tasks will be stored in a file named tasks.txt in the same directory as the script.
Please note that this script assumes a basic command-line interface. You can modify and enhance it further based on your specific requirements and preferences.
